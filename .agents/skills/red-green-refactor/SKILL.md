description: Use to implement one slice test-first with disciplined double-loop TDD — an outer failing end-to-end or integration test wrapping inner unit-test red, green, refactor cycles, worked outside-in until the acceptance test is green. Phase 2 and the heart of the TDD harness. Trigger on 'red green refactor', 'TDD this', 'write a failing test then make it pass', 'implement slice NN', or working through a plan in plans/. Enforces the discipline literally — never write production code without a failing test, watch every test fail first, minimum code to green, refactor only on green.

# Red-Green-Refactor — Double-Loop TDD (Phase 2)

Develop **one slice** by driving it outside-in: a failing acceptance (e2e/integration) test sets the goal, and inner unit-test red→green→refactor cycles build the code that makes it pass. Both test layers grow together. This is the core discipline of the whole harness.

**Read `references/red-green-refactor-philosophy.md` now** if you have not this session — it is the authoritative rulebook, and everything below is a summary of it. For detecting and running the project's test tooling (unit runner + Playwright e2e) across stacks, read `references/test-strategy.md`.

## Input

A slice plan: `plans/<feature-slug>/<NN>-<slice-slug>.md`. If the user names a slice, open that file. If no plan exists, stop and run `tdd-plan` first (or ask the user to) — **no code before a plan**. Work on exactly one slice; never batch slices.

## Setup (once per slice)

1. **Read the plan.** Internalise the goal, the acceptance criterion (Given/When/Then), the seeded unit test list, and what's out of scope.
2. **Cut the branch.** From an up-to-date `main`, create `feat/<feature-slug>/<NN>-<slice-slug>` (see `references/test-strategy.md` if unsure). Never develop a slice on `main`.
3. **Detect test tooling.** Identify the unit runner and the e2e setup (see `references/test-strategy.md`). If Playwright (or a unit runner) is needed and absent, set it up now as part of the slice — a walking-skeleton slice exists precisely to establish this.

## The OUTER loop (acceptance / e2e — the "are we done" signal)

4. **Write ONE failing acceptance test** for the slice's acceptance criterion, exercising the system **only through its real external endpoint** (a browser page via Playwright, an HTTP route, a CLI invocation) — never by calling internal code. Use the user's language. For a browser slice, configure the Playwright acceptance project to **record video** (`video: 'on'`) and take a screenshot at the decisive assertion, so the passing run produces the recording and screenshot `safe-pr` attaches as evidence (the harness requires both).
5. **Run it and watch it fail.** Confirm it fails **because the feature is absent**, with a readable diagnostic — not because of a typo, missing import, or misconfigured harness. If you can't articulate why it fails, you don't understand the requirement yet. This failing acceptance test is now your progress meter; it stays red until the slice is done.

## The INNER loop (unit — the "how / quality" signal)

Repeat per behaviour, working **inward from the boundary** named by the acceptance test. Mock collaborators that don't exist yet to design their interfaces cheaply.

6. **THINK.** Pick the single smallest next behaviour that moves the acceptance test toward green. Add it to the plan's unit test list if it's new.
7. **RED.** Write one small failing unit test (~5 lines). Run it. **Watch it fail for the right reason** and check the diagnostic is clear.
8. **GREEN.** Write the **minimum** code to pass — Fake It / hard-code a constant if you're unsure; ugliness is fine here. Run the behaviour's unit test plus the full **unit** suite (not the slow e2e suite — that runs when closing the loop and before commit) and confirm green. Implement **nothing** that no test demands.
9. **REFACTOR (only on green).** Remove duplication (especially any hard-coding from step 8), clarify names, extract collaborators — **without changing behaviour**. Re-run tests after **each** small change. If a refactor reddens the bar, **revert it — do not fix forward**. Add no new behaviour.
10. **Log it.** Append a one-line entry to the plan's "Status / progress log" (e.g. `<date> green: TokenGenerator returns url-safe token`). Tick the unit-list checkbox.
11. **Step sizing.** Obvious Implementation when confident; Fake It when unsure; Triangulate (require a second example) before generalising. On any **unexpected red**, downshift to smaller steps and run tests more often.

Repeat 6–11 until enough code exists for the acceptance test to pass.

## Close the OUTER loop

12. **Re-run the acceptance test.** If still red, you're missing a piece — return to the inner loop. If green, the slice's behaviour is demonstrably complete — confirm the passing acceptance run produced a **video recording and a screenshot** (re-run with `video: 'on'` if not), since `safe-pr` attaches them as evidence.
13. **Outer refactor.** With the **whole suite green**, clean up across module/boundary scope (duplication between the new code and existing code, leaky abstractions, names). Re-run the full suite after each change.
14. **Full green check + commit.** Run the entire suite (unit + e2e) and confirm green. Commit in small, green-only commits using Conventional Commit style, e.g. `feat(<feature-slug>): <goal> [slice NN]`. Never commit on red. (You may leave one test red in the **uncommitted** working tree as a cross-session resume marker, but never commit or push a red bar.)
15. **Update the plan.** Mark the Definition-of-Done boxes that are now satisfied; set the slice status toward done.

## Invariants — must hold at all times

- No production code exists without a failing test (unit **or** acceptance) that you watched **fail first**. For a walking skeleton, the failing acceptance test may be the only driver.
- The bar is **green before and after every refactoring**; never refactor on red.
- **No new behaviour during a refactor** — structure only. New behaviour needs a fresh RED.
- **Done = the acceptance/e2e test is green** and the full suite passes — not unit coverage. Never trade global correctness for local coverage.
- Eliminate duplication before closing each cycle.
- When stuck or surprised by red: **shrink the step and run the tests more.**

## Both test layers, always

This harness requires **both** unit tests and end-to-end/integration tests, and double-loop TDD is how they coexist: the e2e test defines and gates the slice; the unit tests drive and verify the internals. You cannot finish the slice until the e2e test is green, and you never write internal code without a unit test — so both suites accumulate together. See `references/test-strategy.md` for how each layer is written and run, and how Playwright is configured to capture the screenshots and recordings that `safe-pr` will attach as review evidence.

## Hand-off

When the slice is green and committed, tell the user it's ready and recommend the next phases: `tdd-ci` to run these tests in GitHub Actions, then `safe-pr` to open the reviewable PR. If running under `tdd-harness`, return control to the orchestrator.
